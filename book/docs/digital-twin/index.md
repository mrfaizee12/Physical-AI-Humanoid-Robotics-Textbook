# Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to the Digital Twin module focusing on physics-accurate digital twins using Gazebo and Unity for humanoid robot simulation. This module will teach you how to create realistic simulation environments for humanoid robots that accurately model physics, rendering, and sensor data generation.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:

- How to set up realistic physics simulation in Gazebo with gravity, collision detection, and environmental interactions
- How to create interactive Unity scenes with high-fidelity rendering for human-robot interaction scenarios
- How to generate realistic sensor data (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU) for perception tasks

## Target Audience

This module is designed for students building physical-AI humanoid simulations who want to understand and implement digital twin technology for robotics applications.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of robotics simulation concepts
- Familiarity with Gazebo and/or Unity (helpful but not required)
- Understanding of sensor data in robotics applications

## Module Structure

The Digital Twin module is organized into the following sections:

### 1. [Gazebo Physics Simulation](./gazebo-physics-simulation)
Learn about physics simulation in Gazebo for humanoid robots, including gravity configuration, collision detection, and environmental interactions.

### 2. [Unity Interaction & Rendering](./unity-interaction-rendering)
Discover how to create interactive Unity scenes with high-fidelity rendering for human-robot interaction scenarios.

### 3. [Sensor Simulation Pipeline](./sensor-simulation-pipeline)
Understand how to generate realistic sensor data (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU) for perception tasks like point cloud processing and motion tracking.

### 4. [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart)
Get up and running quickly with the Digital Twin module with step-by-step instructions and examples.
