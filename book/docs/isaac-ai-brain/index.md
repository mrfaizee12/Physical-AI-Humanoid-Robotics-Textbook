# Isaac AI Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to the Isaac AI Brain module focusing on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 for humanoid robot perception and navigation. This module will teach you how to create advanced perception systems using NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem for humanoid robots.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn:

- How to generate photorealistic synthetic datasets using NVIDIA Isaac Sim for perception model training
- How to implement GPU-accelerated Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) using Isaac ROS
- How to configure Nav2 for humanoid-specific path planning with bipedal locomotion constraints

## Target Audience

This module is designed for students applying AI perception and navigation to humanoid robots who want to understand and implement advanced perception systems using NVIDIA Isaac technology.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of robotics perception concepts
- Familiarity with NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem (helpful but not required)
- Understanding of synthetic data generation for ML training

## Module Structure

The Isaac AI Brain module is organized into the following sections:

### 1. [Isaac Sim for Photorealism + Synthetic Data Generation](./isaac-sim-synthetic-data)
Learn about synthetic data generation for perception tasks, following reproducible examples to create training datasets, and understanding Isaac Sim environment configuration.

### 2. [Isaac ROS for VSLAM + Navigation (GPU-accelerated)](./isaac-ros-vslam)
Discover GPU-accelerated visual SLAM capabilities, practice with perception and navigation examples, and learn about Isaac ROS component integration.

### 3. [Nav2 Path Planning Pipeline for Humanoid Locomotion](./nav2-path-planning)
Understand path planning specifically configured for bipedal movement, apply navigation techniques to humanoid robots, and integrate perception and navigation systems.

### 4. [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart)
Get up and running quickly with the Isaac AI Brain module with step-by-step instructions and examples.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Generate synthetic datasets using Isaac Sim with proper annotations for perception tasks
- Implement GPU-accelerated VSLAM pipeline using Isaac ROS components
- Configure Nav2 for humanoid-specific locomotion constraints and path planning
- Implement reproducible examples using Spec-Kit and Claude Code

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart) to set up your environment and run your first Isaac simulation. Then proceed through each chapter to master the individual components before integrating them into complete perception and navigation systems.

## Reproducible Examples

Throughout this module, you'll find reproducible examples that demonstrate key concepts. These examples are designed to work with the provided tools and can be executed to validate your understanding.

## Success Criteria

Upon completion of this module, you should be able to:

- Generate datasets using Isaac Sim with proper annotations
- Process visual input through Isaac ROS nodes in real-time for VSLAM
- Plan and execute paths for humanoid robots using Nav2
- Reproduce all simulation examples using Spec-Kit and Claude Code tools
- Document your work following IEEE citation format
- Ensure each documentation page contains ≤1,500 tokens for RAG compatibility
