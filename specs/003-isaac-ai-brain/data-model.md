## Relationships

### Synthetic Dataset → VSLAM Pipeline
- A synthetic dataset can be used to train or validate a VSLAM pipeline
- Multiple datasets may be used for a single pipeline
- Pipelines may be validated against multiple datasets

### VSLAM Pipeline → Humanoid Navigation Plan
- A VSLAM pipeline provides pose estimates that inform navigation planning
- Navigation plans depend on accurate pose estimation from VSLAM
- Multiple VSLAM configurations may support different navigation scenarios

### Humanoid Navigation Plan → Synthetic Dataset
- Navigation plans may be validated using synthetic datasets
- Synthetic environments may be created to test specific navigation scenarios
- Dataset environments may inform navigation constraints
