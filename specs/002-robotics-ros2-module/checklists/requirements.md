# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-09
**Feature**: [specs/002-robotics-ros2-module/spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs are mentioned as part of the *problem domain*, not the *solution*)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs (learner's educational journey)
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders (clear, educational focus)
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (phrased as outcomes, not implementation checks)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified (implicitly in the description)

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The specification is well-defined and based on a very detailed user prompt. It is ready for the planning phase.
