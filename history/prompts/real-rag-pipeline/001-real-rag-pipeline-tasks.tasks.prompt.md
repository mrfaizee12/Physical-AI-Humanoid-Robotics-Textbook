## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for the real RAG pipeline implementation. The tasks.md file includes 22 specific tasks organized by user story priority, with proper formatting following the checklist format (checkbox, ID, parallel markers, user story labels). Tasks are organized into phases: Setup, Foundational, and User Stories (US1, US2, US3) with a final Polish phase. Each task includes specific file paths and clear implementation instructions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown for real RAG pipeline implementation with 22 specific tasks
- 🧪 Tests: No tests created at tasks generation stage
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with properly formatted tasks organized by user stories
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks follow proper format and enable independent implementation of each user story

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All tasks follow required format and organization
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation with Phase 1 tasks
